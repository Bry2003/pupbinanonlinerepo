Instead, it should be accessible, discoverable, and impactful. That’s why IntelHub provides a digital space where undergraduate theses, capstone projects, faculty research, technical papers, case studies, and digital learning materials are archived and made available to a wider audience. By doing so, we not only support academic collaboration and lifelong learning but also contribute to solving real-world problems through informed insights and evidence-based knowledge.</p><p data-start="1267" data-end="1647" style="text-align: justify;">Our repository is more than just a collection of documents—it is a living archive that evolves with each academic year, capturing the ideas, innovations, and achievements of the PUP Biñan community. Whether you are a student seeking inspiration, a researcher looking for credible sources, or a faculty member aiming to showcase your work, IntelHub is here to support your journey.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
