DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR INFINITYFREE.COM
=======================================

1. PREPARE FILES
   - Rename 'production_config.sample.php' to 'production_config.php'.
   - Open 'production_config.php' and update the database credentials.
     (You will get these details from InfinityFree after creating a database).

2. DATABASE SETUP
   - Log in to InfinityFree Control Panel (cPanel).
   - Go to "MySQL Databases".
   - Create a new database (e.g., 'pupbinan_db').
   - Note down the:
     - MySQL Hostname (usually something like sql123.infinityfree.com)
     - MySQL User Name (e.g., if0_12345678)
     - MySQL Password (your vPanel password)
     - MySQL Database Name (e.g., if0_12345678_pupbinan_db)
   - Update 'production_config.php' with these values.
   - Go to "phpMyAdmin" in the Control Panel.
   - Select your database.
   - Import the 'pupbinanonlinerepo_db.sql' file (if you have the SQL export).
     * If you don't have the SQL file, export it from your local phpMyAdmin first.

3. UPLOAD FILES
   - Use an FTP client (like FileZilla) or the "Online File Manager".
   - Upload ALL files from your project folder to the 'htdocs' folder on InfinityFree.
     - IMPORTANT: Do NOT upload the 'c:\xampp\...' folder itself. 
     - Upload the CONTENTS of your project folder into 'htdocs'.
   - Ensure 'production_config.php' is uploaded.

4. VERIFY
   - Open your website URL.
   - If you see a database connection error, double-check 'production_config.php'.
   - If images are missing, ensure the 'uploads' folder permissions are set to 755 or 777 (if supported).

TROUBLESHOOTING
- "Connection failed": Wrong DB host, user, or password.
- "404 Not Found": Missing .htaccess or files not in 'htdocs'.
- "403 Forbidden": Directory listing is disabled (this is good) or index.php is missing.
